# FreeCell — Projects

Forward-looking product/engineering initiatives for FreeCell. This is a lightweight
registry: each entry is a short description plus a pointer to a design note under
[`projects/`](projects/).

> Not to be confused with [`specs/projects/`](specs/projects/), which holds the
> spec-driven **planning + build** artifacts for a phase of work (overview →
> functional spec → architecture → implementation plan). `projects/` here is a
> backlog of *initiatives and design notes* — some future, some speculative.

## Backlog

> **Known gaps** (things missing / partial / deferred, as opposed to the forward-looking
> initiatives below) live in the running log at [`GAPS.md`](GAPS.md). Several entries
> below are the *design notes* for gaps tracked there (type-aware alignment, bundled
> Inter, pre-distribution audit).

- **All-Styles Resident Cache (grid geometry + styling)** — *Near-MVP.*
  An always-resident cache of the full resolved style for the sheet — **all** row/col
  sizes (geometry) + fills/lines/bold/number-format — **not** viewport-based. Needed to
  render the grid at all (geometry), takes the ~10× style read (SP4) off the scroll path,
  and — since styles/sizes don't change during a recompute and it's frontend-resident —
  lets the grid render **fully-styled during an eval** (only cell values lag).
  → [`projects/style-cache.md`](projects/style-cache.md)

- **`.xlsx` Preservation on Save** — *Future (post-MVP by product call, 2026-07-02).*
  IronCalc's writer silently drops everything it doesn't model (comments, validation,
  hyperlinks, merges, CF — and charts/pivots/drawings/VBA were never examined), so
  "open a colleague's file, fix one cell, save" is destructive. MVP ships this
  behavior with no warning (decided in MVP planning Round 1); this project adds the
  warn-and-strip UX first, then weighs zip-level unknown-part pass-through vs owning
  the writer, plus the real-file-corpus de-risk.
  → [`projects/xlsx-preservation.md`](projects/xlsx-preservation.md)

- **IME / International Text Input** — *Future (post-MVP by product call, 2026-07-02).*
  Full IME (CJK composition), dead keys, layouts, decimal-comma entry for the custom
  raw-gpui cell editor. What GPUI exposes at the pinned rev is unknown — carries a cheap
  probe to run before the editor architecture hardens.
  → [`projects/ime-text-input.md`](projects/ime-text-input.md)

- **Excel Clipboard Interop** — *Future (post-MVP by product call, 2026-07-02).*
  Rich range copy/paste with Excel via TSV + HTML/XML-Spreadsheet clipboard flavors.
  All FreeCell-side work (IronCalc's clipboard isn't externally chainable); plain TSV
  values may ride along with the editor build.
  → [`projects/excel-clipboard.md`](projects/excel-clipboard.md)

- **Merged Cells (render + selection + merge/unmerge UI)** — *Future (deferred from `mvp-gaps` scope-back, 2026-07-04; tiers a+b ready to build).*
  Full merged-cell support. Tiers a+b (render file-loaded merges + selection
  correctness) are investigated, need **zero engine changes**, and are ready to build
  as a focused project; tier c (merge/unmerge UI) is blocked on an IronCalc
  `UserModel` merge API (upstream PR preferred, minimal patch-fork fallback) + the
  structural-edit merge-adjustment landmine. `mvp-gaps` ships only a guard blocking
  insert/delete rows/cols that would displace merges.
  → [`projects/merged-cells.md`](projects/merged-cells.md)

- **IronCalc — move to a released pin** — *Future (follow-up tail of `ironcalc-upstreaming`).*
  That project upgrades FreeCell onto the fork's git-`main` + our E2/E5 fixes (migrating to the
  new `Color`-enum API and deleting `open_fixups`/`open_repair` + `roxmltree`/`zip`). This tail
  swaps the temporary `[patch.crates-io]` git pin for a **released** IronCalc version once one
  ships with all five fixes, and re-validates. → [`projects/ironcalc-upgrade.md`](projects/ironcalc-upgrade.md)

- **Viewport Value Cache** — *Future, optional scroll-perf push.*
  Delta-load only newly-exposed cells' *values* on scroll (styles/geometry come from the
  resident style cache above); invalidate on recompute. Optional — SP4 showed uncached
  value reads are cheap. → [`projects/viewport-cache.md`](projects/viewport-cache.md)

- **Bundled Inter Font** — *Implemented (2026-07-06).*
  Inter (SIL OFL) is now vendored (`crates/freecell-app/assets/fonts/inter/`) and registered
  at startup via GPUI `add_fonts` (`shell/fonts.rs`); the grid + chrome render Inter on every
  platform. This closed a real bug — the deferral assumed baseline stability was "already
  delivered" by pinning the runner, but on Linux the default font silently rendered bold/italic
  as regular, so baselines were untrustworthy. Bundling fixed bold/italic and made macOS, Linux,
  and CI render the same font. → [`projects/bundled-inter-font.md`](projects/bundled-inter-font.md)

- **Type-Aware Default Cell Alignment (+ number-format text color)** — *Future (deferred
  from MVP Phase 13).* Render Excel's type-based default alignment (numbers/dates right,
  booleans/errors center) and `[Red]`-style number-format text color. The MVP publishes
  only a display string per cell (`PublishedCell`), so every cell defaults to left and
  text is the default color; values/formats/errors are correct, and *explicit* alignment
  renders correctly. Needs the worker to publish per-cell value type + resolved color.
  → [`projects/type-aware-alignment.md`](projects/type-aware-alignment.md)

- **Pre-Distribution Security & License Audit** — *Future, MANDATORY before shipping any
  binary.* Re-audit `cargo-deny`: resolve the GPL `ztracing` license exception (zed#55470)
  and the quick-xml ≥0.41 DoS advisories (transitive via ironcalc's xlsx reader + zed's
  wayland/atspi stack), tighten bans/sources. No safe upgrade exists at the pinned gpui/
  ironcalc revs today; FreeCell ships no binaries yet, so the documented posture is
  acceptable for now. → [`projects/pre-distribution-security-audit.md`](projects/pre-distribution-security-audit.md)

- **Window UI Scaling / Zoom** — *Explored + declined (2026-07-08).*
  A per-window zoom for spreadsheet windows (a Window menu of 70–150% multipliers of the
  OS-DPI default), scaling the whole content area. Declined because shipping it needs a
  maintained zed fork: at the pinned gpui rev `Window::scale_factor` is a read-only,
  OS-derived getter re-read on every `bounds_changed` (no app-facing `set_scale_factor`,
  `WindowOptions` has no scale field), there's no element-subtree scale transform, and
  `set_rem_size` only scales rem units while the grid is all px. The only ship routes are a
  gpui fork (a settable, viewport-consistent per-window scale override) or a rem-based layout
  rewrite incl. the grid's px geometry — too much long-term scope/maintenance for the value,
  and gpui here is pinned-not-forked. → [`projects/window-scaling.md`](projects/window-scaling.md)

- **Windows Port** — *Future (packaging wired 2026-07-05; app build not a real target).*
  Make FreeCell compile + run on Windows (GPUI DirectX backend, `cfg(windows)` dep split,
  Windows arms for the macOS/Linux-gated code paths), then promote the already-wired NSIS
  installer + Windows CI job from experimental (`continue-on-error`) to supported. The
  `cargo-packager` work added the packaging half; the app half is untouched.
  → [`projects/windows-port.md`](projects/windows-port.md)

- **Release Signing & Distribution** — *Future, required before publishing any binary.*
  The `cargo-packager` pipeline ships **unsigned dev artifacts** (uploaded as CI run
  artifacts, not GitHub Releases) by deliberate scope decision — no signing config/hooks
  exist. This adds macOS Developer-ID signing + notarization, Windows Authenticode, and the
  switch to attaching signed assets to a GitHub Release. Hard-gated on the
  pre-distribution security audit above. → [`projects/release-signing-and-distribution.md`](projects/release-signing-and-distribution.md)
