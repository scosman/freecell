//! The custom virtualized spreadsheet grid (`components/grid.md`, `ui_design.md §3.3`).
//!
//! A raw-GPUI view that renders headers, gridlines, cells, and selection for an Excel-max
//! sheet, reading **only** from the resident caches and the published viewport — the render
//! path makes zero engine calls and materializes only the visible viewport
//! (`architecture.md §4`). Port-and-extend of the proven POC
//! (`experiments/04-ui-poc/raw-gpui/src/grid.rs`).
//!
//! Phase 6 scope: static rendering + wheel scroll + clamping + overlay scrollbars +
//! loading overlay, driven by hand-built `freecell-core` fixtures. Phase 8 adds the input
//! plumbing: mouse selection (click / drag / shift-click + edge auto-scroll), keyboard
//! motions dispatched through `freecell_core::apply_motion`, and the `SelectionChanged` /
//! `ClearCells` events (`components/grid.md §Input`, `ui_design.md §5–6`).
