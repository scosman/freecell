# Architecture: Merged Cell UI

Technical design for the merged-cell UI. Consumes the merged-cell API on the IronCalc
fork; makes merges render, select/edit as one unit, and be created/removed from the app.
All work lands in existing crates — **no new components warrant separate docs**, so this
is a **single architecture doc (1-phase)**.

## Crate touch-map

| Concern | Crate / file | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Engine pin | `app/Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock` | re-pin `freecell-fixes` to the merge-carrying tip |
| Engine wrapper | `freecell-engine/src/document.rs` | `merge_cells` / `unmerge_cells` / `merged_regions` |
| Command/event | `freecell-engine/src/worker/protocol.rs` | `Command::{MergeCells,UnmergeCells}`, `WorkerEvent::MergeNeedsConfirm` |
| Apply + guard | `freecell-engine/src/worker/run.rs` | apply arms; drop insert/delete guard; keep fill guard |
| Resident merge state | `freecell-engine/src/cache.rs`, `freecell-core/src/cache.rs` | build `MergeMap` from `get_merge_cells` |
| Merge logic (pure) | `freecell-core/src/merge.rs` (new) | region lookups + fixpoint snap + fill predicate |
| Selection | `freecell-core/src/selection.rs` | merge-aware `apply_motion`, `snap_cell`, `effective_range` |
| Render | `freecell-app/src/grid/view.rs` | region-draw pass, skip covered, span outlines/editor |
| Control | `freecell-app/src/chrome/view.rs` | action-row toggle + `toggle_merge` + data-loss dialog |
| Menu/shortcut | `freecell-app/src/shell/menus.rs`, `shell/window.rs` | Edit-menu item + ⌃⌘M + modal wiring |

## 1. Re-pin (Phase 1, first step)

FreeCell pins IronCalc by **branch** (`freecell-fixes`), so "newer branch version" is a
`Cargo.lock` bump, not a `Cargo.toml` edit. From `app/`:

```
cargo update -p ironcalc -p ironcalc_base   # advances the locked freecell-fixes rev to the merge tip (b922df5)
```

Verify the locked rev carries the merge API (`git grep merge_cells` in the vendored source
is unnecessary — a `cargo build -p freecell-engine` referencing `self.model.merge_cells`
compiles only against the new tip). This is the first commit of Phase 1.

## 2. Data model — the resident `MergeMap`

The UI must answer "is this cell in a region / which region / does this range hit a region"
**synchronously** on the render + input threads (no per-keystroke worker round-trip). The
authoritative merge list therefore lives in the **resident cache** (`Arc<RwLock<SheetCaches>>`),
refreshed on every publish — the same channel that already carries styles/geometry.

Today `freecell-core/src/cache.rs` stores `merges: Vec<CellRange>` (0-based, file-loaded, for
the guard). We keep the storage a `Vec<CellRange>` (merge counts are small — a few hundred;
no per-cell index, which would blow up on a whole-column merge) and add the query logic as
**pure free functions** in a new `freecell-core/src/merge.rs`, mirroring the existing
`merge_guard.rs` free-predicate pattern. `merge.rs` **absorbs** `blocks_fill` from
`merge_guard.rs`; `blocks_row_op`/`blocks_col_op` are **deleted** (§5).

```rust
// freecell-core/src/merge.rs  — all take the resident 0-based regions slice
/// The region covering `cell` (anchor start = region.start), or None.
pub fn region_at(merges: &[CellRange], cell: CellRef) -> Option<CellRange>;
/// region_at(cell).map(|r| r.start) — the anchor a covered cell edits/selects to.
pub fn anchor_of(merges: &[CellRange], cell: CellRef) -> Option<CellRef>;
/// Regions that intersect `range` (⩝ for toggle/unmerge/data-loss).
pub fn regions_intersecting(merges: &[CellRange], range: CellRange) -> Vec<CellRange>;
/// Fixpoint: grow `range` until it fully contains every region it touches (§7).
pub fn expand_to_regions(merges: &[CellRange], range: CellRange) -> CellRange;
/// Fill (⌘D/⌘R) target intersects any region → reject (moved from merge_guard).
pub fn blocks_fill(merges: &[CellRange], target: CellRange) -> bool;
```

`region_at` is a linear scan; render bounds its cost by scanning only `visible_merges` (§6).
The cache keeps `merges()`/`push_merge`/`merge` (fluent, used by fixtures) unchanged.

**Coordinate conversion.** Engine `MergeCell { row, column, width, height }` is **1-based**
`(row, column)` with `width`=cols, `height`=rows. FreeCell `CellRange` is **0-based**. The
one conversion site is `Document` (§3):

```
CellRange::new(
  CellRef::new((row-1) as u32, (column-1) as u32),
  CellRef::new((row-1+height-1) as u32, (column-1+width-1) as u32),
)
```

## 3. Engine wrapper + command/event plumbing

The UI never calls `Document` directly — it sends `Command`s to the worker, which mutates
`Document` in `apply_one` and republishes. Add:

**`document.rs`** (next to `merge_ranges`, using `record_engine_call()`):
```rust
pub(crate) fn merge_cells(&mut self, sheet: u32, area: CellRange) -> Result<(), String>;   // area 0-based; converts to 1-based (row,col,width,height) and calls self.model.merge_cells
pub(crate) fn unmerge_cells(&mut self, sheet: u32, anchor: CellRef) -> Result<(), String>; // calls self.model.unmerge_cells(sheet, row, col)
pub(crate) fn merged_regions(&self, sheet: u32) -> Result<Vec<CellRange>, String>;          // wraps self.model.get_merge_cells → 0-based CellRanges
pub(crate) fn merge_would_lose_data(&self, sheet: u32, area: CellRange) -> Result<bool, String>; // §8
```
`merged_regions` **replaces** the cache's raw-string `merge_ranges` parse — the resident map
now comes from the normalized engine API, so it reflects post-displacement truth.

**`worker/protocol.rs`:**
```rust
Command::MergeCells   { sheet: SheetId, area: CellRange, confirmed: bool }
Command::UnmergeCells { sheet: SheetId, anchor: CellRef }
WorkerEvent::MergeNeedsConfirm { sheet: SheetId, area: CellRange }   // data-loss round-trip (§8)
```
`EditRejectedReason::MergedCells` is **retained but re-scoped to fill only** (§5, §9).

**`worker/run.rs` — `apply_one`:**
- `Command::MergeCells { sheet, area, confirmed }`:
  - if `!confirmed && doc.merge_would_lose_data(idx, area)?` → emit `WorkerEvent::MergeNeedsConfirm { sheet, area }`, return `AppliedKind::NoOp` (no mutation).
  - else → `doc.merge_cells(idx, area)?` → `AppliedKind::Structure`.
- `Command::UnmergeCells { sheet, anchor }` → `doc.unmerge_cells(idx, anchor)?` → `AppliedKind::Structure`.
- `AppliedKind::Structure` already triggers eval + full republish, which **rebuilds the cache
  and re-reads `merged_regions`** — so the resident `MergeMap` and all cell values refresh in
  one frame (satisfies F7). Merge clears covered content → eval is correct via Structure.

**`cache.rs` (engine build loop, ~:408):** replace the `ws.merge_cells` string parse with
`doc.merged_regions(sheet)` → `push_merge` per region.

## 4. Undo/redo

No new UI code: merge/unmerge are single IronCalc history steps (engine-guaranteed).
`Command::Undo/Redo` already round-trip and republish → the `MergeMap` and discarded content
restore together. Add worker regression tests (§10), not new plumbing.

## 5. Retire the interim guard (structural edits now displace)

The engine displaces merges across insert/delete (grow/shrink/drop, never split), so:

- **`worker/run.rs` `pre_validate`:** remove the `merge_guard` arms for `InsertRows`,
  `DeleteRows`, `InsertColumns`, `DeleteColumns`. **Keep** the arms for `FillDown`,
  `FillRight`, `FillDrag` (fill into a merge stays rejected — documented limitation).
- **`freecell-core`:** delete `blocks_row_op` / `blocks_col_op` (and their tests); `blocks_fill`
  moves into `merge.rs`. `merge_guard.rs` is removed (or reduced to a re-export shim).
- **UI menus (`grid/view.rs`):** delete `merge_block_flags` and the insert/delete disable flags +
  the "Sheet has merged cells — not yet supported here." footnote in `header_menu_items` /
  `cell_menu_items` (insert/delete items now always enabled). The `cache.merges()` read on
  right-click that fed the flags is removed.
- **Move rows/columns:** N/A — FreeCell has no such gesture (only sheet-tab reorder), so the
  engine's split-move `Err` is unreachable.

## 6. Rendering (grid/view.rs)

**Snapshot (in `resolve_frame`, mirroring `visible_border_specs` at ~:1103):**
```rust
self.visible_merges = merge::regions_intersecting(cache.merges(), visible_range);  // Vec<CellRange>
```
So the per-frame region set is small (regions touching the viewport, incl. anchors scrolled
off-screen).

**Cell loop (`build_grid_layers`, ~:2906):** skip any `(r,c)` that belongs to a region:
`if visible_merges.iter().any(|m| m.contains((r,c))) { continue; }`. This removes covered
content **and** the covered cells' right/bottom gridline edges → interior gridlines vanish.

**Region pass (new, after the cell loop):** for each `region` in `visible_merges`, emit **one**
`cell_element`-equivalent at `span_rect(region.rows, region.cols, frame)`:
- fill = anchor's `RenderStyle` fill; content = anchor's publication value, formatted per anchor
  style; h/v-align from the anchor (no centering added); font/wrap from anchor.
- draws the region box's **outer** right/bottom gridline (the box element's own borders);
  the box's left/top gridlines are drawn by the normal neighbor cells above/left, as today.
- `span_rect` handles an off-screen anchor (negative offset) with normal viewport clipping.

**Explicit borders (second pass, `border_spec_at`):** skip interior covered edges; draw the
anchor's explicit border edges at the box outer edge. (Per-cell stored styles only — no
unified-border synthesis; F1/UI §3 scope.)

**Text-spill pass (~:3105):** a region anchor's available width is the **box** width; covered
cells never originate spill.

**Selection overlays (~:3124–3161):**
- active-cell outline: `let r = merge::region_at(cache.merges(), sel.active).unwrap_or(single(sel.active)); span_rect(r)`.
- range fill + 2px range border: driven by `effective_range(sel, merges)` (§7) — already whole
  regions, so no partial slivers.

**In-cell editor (`in_cell_overlay_elements`, ~:5022):** base rect = `span_rect(region_at(cell))`
when `cell` is in a region (it will be the anchor — §7), else `cell_rect(cell)`; `incell_geom`
growth seeds from that base.

## 7. Selection & editing (freecell-core/selection.rs + grid input)

**Invariant:** `SelectionModel { anchor, active }` never stores a **covered** cell — any cell
entering `anchor`/`active` is snapped to its region anchor. This keeps `active` a valid edit
target and the outline/box logic simple.

**New pure helpers (take `merges: &[CellRange]`):**
```rust
fn snap_cell(merges, cell) -> CellRef            // region_at → region.start, else cell
fn effective_range(merges, sel) -> CellRange     // expand_to_regions(bounding_box(anchor, active))
```

**`expand_to_regions` (fixpoint):**
```
loop { changed=false;
  for m in merges { if m intersects range && !range.contains(m) { range = bbox(range ∪ m); changed=true } }
  if !changed break }
```
Grows monotonically, bounded by the sheet → terminates; O(n²) worst, n small. Chained pull-in
(a region added at a new edge pulls the next) is covered by the outer loop.

**`apply_motion(sel, motion, dims, merges)` — merge-aware:**
- *Plain arrow* from `active` (a region anchor of region R, or a lone cell):
  - if in region R spanning rows[r0..r1]×cols[c0..c1]: exit past the far edge —
    Right→(r0,c1+1), Left→(r0,c0−1), Down→(r1+1,c0), Up→(r0−1,c0); else normal single step.
  - clamp to `dims`; then `active = snap_cell(landing)`; `anchor = active` (collapse).
- *Shift-extend*: move the `active`-side edge one line, read off `effective_range(sel)` (not the
  raw `active` cell, so it advances off the *whole* region — no "sticking" on a tall/wide merge).
  Whether the step **grows** (edge moving away from the anchor) or **shrinks** (toward it) decides
  how a region the stepped edge lands in is handled: a grow lets `expand_to_regions` swallow it
  whole; a shrink instead moves the contracting (active-side) edge **to the first cell past that
  region in the direction of the step** (i.e. just clear of the merge on the anchor side),
  *excluding* the whole merge (mirroring the plain-arrow exit rule above) — otherwise
  `expand_to_regions` would immediately re-pull it and the edge would stick. Clamp the shrink jump
  so the contracting edge never crosses the anchor (a merge containing the anchor floors the shrink
  at that merge). Then `active = snap_cell(far corner of expand_to_regions(bbox(anchor, stepped)))`;
  keep `anchor`.
- ⌘+arrow (edge-of-data) keeps its async `ResolveEdge` path, then snaps the resolved cell.

**Click / drag (`grid/view.rs`):**
- plain click → `single(snap_cell(clicked))`; shift-click / drag → `anchor` kept,
  `active = snap_cell(cell_at_point)`. `cell_at_point` (layout) is unchanged; snapping is
  applied at the call sites in `mouse_down_cell` / `extend_drag_to_point`.

**Editing commit:** `active` is already the anchor, so `Command::SetCellInput { cell: active }`
never targets a covered cell. Type-to-edit / F2 / double-click all begin on `active`.

**Clear (Delete):** `ClearCells` over `effective_range(sel)` → engine `range_clear_contents`
(clears anchor content, does **not** unmerge; covered cells already empty). No special-casing.

**Ref/formula box:** shows `active` (the anchor) A1 via existing `format_selection_ref`.

## 8. Merge/Unmerge control + data-loss flow (chrome/view.rs)

**Action-row button** (in the alignment/wrap group, after wrap + an `action_divider()`), built
with the existing `toggle` closure; `on_click → this.toggle_merge(window, cx)`.
- `merge_active()` (mirrors `bold_active()`): `!regions_intersecting(merges, effective_range(sel)).is_empty()` → pressed.
- `disabled = self.degraded || (sel is 1×1 && region_at(active).is_none())`.
- tooltip: pressed → "Unmerge cells", else "Merge cells".

**`toggle_merge`:**
```
commit pending edit;
let range = effective_range(sel, merges);
let hit = regions_intersecting(merges, range);
if !hit.is_empty() {                      // UNMERGE all intersecting
    for r in hit { client.send(Command::UnmergeCells { sheet, anchor: r.start }); }
} else if range not 1x1 {                  // MERGE
    client.send(Command::MergeCells { sheet, area: range, confirmed: false });
}
```
**Data-loss round-trip:** the worker answers `MergeCells{confirmed:false}` with either the
merge (no loss) or `WorkerEvent::MergeNeedsConfirm { sheet, area }`. `window.rs` handles that
event by opening the new **`ActiveModal::Confirm`** (title/body/buttons per UI §6); **Merge**
resends `Command::MergeCells { area, confirmed: true }`; **Cancel** dismisses.

`Document::merge_would_lose_data(sheet, area)`: scans the sheet's **populated** cells within
`area` (sparse — via the engine's cell storage, not a dense address walk) and returns `true`
if any non-anchor cell is non-empty. (If `Document` lacks a sparse-in-range iterator, add a
small helper over the worksheet's cell map; never iterate `width*height` addresses — a
whole-column merge would be pathological.)

**Menu + shortcut (`shell/menus.rs`):** `MergeCells` action bound to **⌃⌘M**
(`KeyBinding::new(&key("ctrl-cmd-m"...))` per the repo's key helper) + an Edit-menu
`MergeItem`; the app-level `on_action` calls the same chrome `toggle_merge` (mirrors how
`ToggleBold` routes through `window.rs`).

## 9. Error handling

| Situation | Surface |
|---|---|
| Merge would discard data | `ActiveModal::Confirm` (Merge / Cancel) via `MergeNeedsConfirm` |
| Merge validation `Err` (array/spill collision) | `ActiveModal::Error` (OK), engine reason, no change |
| Fill into a merge | `ActiveModal::Error` (OK), re-worded "Can't fill merged cells" (`MergedCells` reason) |
| Insert/delete near merge | **no dialog** — succeeds via displacement (guard removed) |
| Unmerge on non-merge | engine no-op; toggle never issues it (button inactive) |

The toggle structurally avoids the engine's overlap-reject (it unmerges whenever the selection
hits any region), so `merge_cells` is only ever called on a merge-free rectangle.

## 10. Testing strategy

Match checks to scope (per repo CLAUDE.md — crate-scoped builds; pixel suite is **in scope**
for the region rendering but **not** for the action-row button).

- **Pure unit (`freecell-core`, cheap, no GPUI):** `merge.rs` — `region_at`, `anchor_of`,
  `regions_intersecting`, `expand_to_regions` (single region, chained pull-in, already-contained
  no-op, edge-touch); `selection.rs` — `snap_cell`, `effective_range`, `apply_motion`
  enter/exit a region each direction, shift-extend across a region without sticking, chained-region
  extension, ⌘-arrow snap, grid-boundary clamps.
- **Worker (`freecell-engine`):** MergeCells/UnmergeCells apply + republish refreshes `MergeMap`;
  `MergeNeedsConfirm` fires iff covered non-empty (empty & single-value merge silently);
  `confirmed:true` performs it; insert/delete **displaces** (grow/shrink/drop) with no rejection
  and the cache reflects the new region; fill still rejected; undo/redo restores region + discarded
  content; sheet switch shows per-sheet merges; xlsx round-trip of an **in-app-created** merge
  (create → save → reopen).
- **Render pixel baselines (in scope — grid/cell/sheet):** new `merge_*` cases — basic box
  (content across span, interior gridlines suppressed), box with fill + alignment, active-cell
  outline spanning a region, range selection spanning a region, region at a scroll boundary
  (anchor off-screen), file-loaded merge. Iterate with `render_tests.sh test merge_`; **full**
  suite + CI `render` gate deferred to the dedicated late phase; regenerate + **eyeball**
  baselines for the intentional new rendering.
- **Chrome (`freecell-app` gpui view tests + Xvfb smoke — NOT pixel suite):** button
  enabled/disabled/pressed states across selection kinds; `toggle_merge` decision (merge vs
  unmerge-all vs no-op); ⌃⌘M dispatch; `Confirm` modal copy + Merge/Cancel outcomes.

## 11. Risks & mitigations

- **Merge-aware selection (§7) is the delicate area** the backlog flagged (fixpoint + input
  code). Mitigation: all logic is in pure, unit-tested `merge.rs`/`selection.rs` functions with
  the covered-cell invariant; the grid only calls them. Built + tested as its own phase.
- **Data-loss scan cost** on a huge selection: sparse-in-range iteration only (§8).
- **Off-screen anchor rendering:** the dedicated region pass keyed on `visible_merges` (not the
  cell loop) guarantees a region draws whenever any part is visible.
- **Guard removal correctness:** covered by worker tests asserting displacement + cache refresh;
  the fill guard stays to avoid covered-cell writes.

## 12. Phasing (feeds implementation_plan)

1. **Re-pin + engine/plumbing + resident MergeMap + guard retire** (worker-tested; no visible UI).
2. **Render merges as one box** (region pass, skip covered, span overlays/editor; render subset).
3. **Merge-aware selection & editing** (pure helpers + input call-sites; unit-tested).
4. **Merge/Unmerge control + data-loss dialog** (action row + Edit menu + ⌃⌘M; chrome tests + smoke).
5. **Render validation (dedicated late phase)** — full pixel suite (watchdog) + eyeball/refresh
   `merge_*` baselines + dispatch CI `render` gate green; xlsx round-trip test.
